This is repository for fetching users through GitHub API.
How to launch:

1) Clone repository on your local machine
2) run command: "npm install"
3) After, when you successfully installed node packages run command: "npm run start"
4) open index.html file and run there Live Server
5) You will see page with user's cards

Note: API has limit for requests, so you may see zero numbers in user's stats
Number of repos and Languages I took from different source such as original github URL address
